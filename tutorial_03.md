# Building Your First AI Agent: A ReAct Tutorial for Beginners

## Introduction: What Are We Building?

Imagine teaching a smart assistant to solve problems step-by-step, just like a human would. That's exactly what we're going to build today! We'll create a **ReAct Agent** - a simple AI system that can:
- **Think** about problems
- **Use tools** to get information
- **Reason** through solutions
- **Give you answers**

Think of it like having a helpful assistant who can look things up, do calculations, and explain their thinking along the way.

## Part 1: Understanding the ReAct Pattern

### The Magic Loop

Our AI agent follows a simple pattern called **ReAct** (Reason + Act):

```
1. Thought ‚Üí "I need to find out X"
2. Action ‚Üí "Let me use this tool"
3. PAUSE ‚Üí (We run the tool)
4. Observation ‚Üí "The tool gave me this result"
5. (Repeat if needed)
6. Answer ‚Üí "Here's your final answer!"
```

### Real-World Example

Let's say you ask: "How much does a pen cost?"

The agent thinks like this:
1. **Thought:** "I should look up the pen cost"
2. **Action:** "Use the price-checking tool for 'pen'"
3. **PAUSE** (waits for us to run the tool)
4. **Observation:** "A pen costs $5"
5. **Answer:** "A pen costs $5"

## Part 2: Setting Up Your Environment

### What You'll Need

1. **Python installed** on your computer
2. **An OpenAI API key** (get one from platform.openai.com)
3. **Three Python packages** to install

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install openai python-dotenv httpx
   ```

2. **Create a file called `.env`** in your project folder:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Never share this key or commit it to GitHub!

3. **Create your Python file** called `my_first_agent.py`

## Part 3: Understanding the Code Components

### The Three Tools

Our agent has three "tools" it can use - think of these as special abilities:

```python
def calculate(what):
    """Does math calculations"""
    return eval(what)  # Note: Only safe for classroom use!

def get_cost(thing):
    """Looks up prices from our toy database"""
    if "pen" in thing:
        return "A pen costs $5"
    elif "book" in thing:
        return "A book costs $20"
    else:
        return "Price not found"

def wikipedia(q):
    """Searches Wikipedia for information"""
    # This connects to Wikipedia's API
    # Returns the first search result
```

### The Agent Brain

The `Agent` class is the "brain" of our system:

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, system=""):
        # Stores the instructions (system prompt)
        # Keeps track of the conversation
        
    def __call__(self, message):
        # Receives your message
        # Adds it to the conversation history
        # Gets a response from the AI
        
    def execute(self):
        # Actually calls OpenAI's API
        # Returns the AI's response
```

### The Instructions (System Prompt)

The most important part! This teaches the AI how to behave:

```python
prompt = """
You run in a loop of Thought, Action, PAUSE, Observation.
At the end of the loop you output an Answer.

Your available actions are:
- calculate: Does math (e.g., calculate: 4 * 7)
- get_cost: Gets prices (e.g., get_cost: pen)
- wikipedia: Searches Wikipedia (e.g., wikipedia: Albert Einstein)

[Examples showing the pattern...]
"""
```

## Part 4: How It All Works Together

### The Flow

```
You ‚Üí "What's 1879 √ó 5?"
    ‚Üì
Agent ‚Üí "Thought: I need to calculate this"
Agent ‚Üí "Action: calculate: 1879 * 5"
Agent ‚Üí "PAUSE"
    ‚Üì
Your Code ‚Üí Runs calculate(1879 * 5) = 9395
Your Code ‚Üí "Observation: 9395"
    ‚Üì
Agent ‚Üí "Answer: 1879 √ó 5 = 9395"
```

### Running the Demos

When you run the code, you'll see two demonstrations:

**Demo 1: Simple Price Lookup**
- Question: "How much does a pen cost?"
- Agent uses the `get_cost` tool
- Gets the price ($5)
- Gives you the answer

**Demo 2: Multi-Step Problem**
- Question: "What year was Einstein born? Multiply by 5"
- Agent first uses `wikipedia` to find the year (1879)
- Then uses `calculate` to multiply (1879 √ó 5 = 9395)
- Combines both results in the final answer

## Part 5: Understanding the Output

### What You'll See

```
--- Demo 1 ---
Thought: I should look up the pen cost using get_cost.
Action: get_cost: pen
PAUSE
Observation: A pen costs $5
Answer: A pen costs $5
```

### Why Sometimes You See Extra Lines?

If the agent "guesses" before getting the tool result, you might see:
- First answer (the guess): "A pen costs $3"
- Then the observation: "A pen costs $5"
- Updated answer (the correction): "A pen costs $5"

**This is good!** It shows the agent learns from the tools and corrects itself.

## Part 6: Try It Yourself!

### Experiment Ideas

1. **Add a new price** to the `get_cost` function:
   ```python
   elif "laptop" in thing:
       return "A laptop costs $1000"
   ```

2. **Ask different questions:**
   ```python
   my_agent("Question: How much would 3 books cost?")
   # The agent should use get_cost then calculate!
   ```

3. **Create a new tool:**
   ```python
   def get_weather(city):
       return f"The weather in {city} is sunny and 72¬∞F"
   ```

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "API key not found" | Check your `.env` file is in the right folder |
| Agent gives wrong answer | Make sure temperature=0 for consistency |
| Tool not recognized | Add it to the `known_actions` dictionary |
| Agent keeps talking after Answer | In production, stop after the first "Answer:" |

## Part 7: Key Concepts to Remember

### The Mental Model

Think of your ReAct agent like a smart assistant with:
- üß† **Brain** (LLM) - Plans and decides
- üôå **Hands** (Tools) - Do the actual work
- üëÄ **Eyes** (Observations) - See the results
- ‚úÖ **Answer** - The final conclusion

### Why This Matters

1. **Transparency**: You can see the agent's thinking process
2. **Accuracy**: Tools provide real data, not guesses
3. **Control**: You decide what tools are available
4. **Learning**: Perfect for understanding how AI agents work!

## Part 8: Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with this basic agent:

1. **Add more tools** (weather API, calculator with safety checks, database lookups)
2. **Improve the prompt** to handle edge cases
3. **Build a web interface** so others can use your agent
4. **Create specialized agents** for specific tasks (research assistant, math tutor, etc.)

## Summary

Congratulations! You've built your first AI agent that can:
- Think through problems step-by-step
- Use tools to get real information
- Combine multiple steps to solve complex problems
- Explain its reasoning clearly

This ReAct pattern is the foundation of many modern AI applications. You're now ready to explore more advanced agent architectures!
